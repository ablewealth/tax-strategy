# üîê API Key Security Guide - Updated

## üö® IMPORTANT SECURITY UPDATE

The application has been redesigned to use a secure backend proxy for all API calls. This significantly improves security by keeping API keys off the client side.

### New Architecture

1. **Frontend**: No longer contains any API keys
2. **Backend**: Securely stores API keys in environment variables
3. **API Proxy**: All API calls are proxied through the backend server

## üõ°Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Local Development

1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
   - Copy the example env file: `cp .env.example .env`
   - Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     PORT=3001
     ```
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the backend: `npm start`

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - In the project root, copy the example env file: `cp .env.example .env`
   - Configure the backend URL:
     ```
     REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
     ```
   - Start the frontend: `npm start`

### Production Deployment

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy the backend to a secure server
   - Set up environment variables on your server
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured

2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Add a GitHub Secret called `BACKEND_URL` with your production backend URL
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically use this URL during build

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **API Key Restrictions**:
   - Set up API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
   - Restrict by HTTP referrers to your backend domain
   - Set up API usage quotas

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use different API keys for development and production
   - Regularly rotate your API keys

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud Console
   - Monitor API usage regularly
   - Check for unusual activity patterns

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend server is running with valid API key
- [ ] Frontend is configured with correct backend URL
- [ ] Environment Configuration panel shows "Connected ‚úÖ"
- [ ] AI analysis generation works correctly
- [ ] API key is not visible in frontend code or network requests

## üîÑ Migration from Previous Version

If you were using the previous version with the API key in the frontend:

1. Remove any `REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY` from frontend `.env` files
2. Set up the backend server as described above
3. Update the frontend to use `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` instead

This new architecture provides significantly better security by ensuring API keys are never exposed to client-side code.
